# Wind-Farm-Site-Suitability-Analysis
Determine the optimal location for a set of new high-efficiency wind turbines in Colorado.
The selected site must meet several characteristics:

Located in the state of Colorado
In counties where the population as of 2010 is at least 20,000
In areas where the wind power class is at least 4 (Annual wind speeds in these areas at 10 meters off the ground are generally at least 5.6 meters per second [12.5 mph], and at 50 meters off the ground are generally 7.0 meters per second [15.7 mph].)
Within 10 miles of existing power lines that have a capacity of at least 400 kilovolts (kV)
Within 5 miles of existing wind farms containing turbines where the rotor diameters span at least 100 feet
